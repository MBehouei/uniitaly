                    <p class="about__text">

                        What is GMAT?
                        The GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test) is a standardized test used by business schools
                        worldwide as part of the admissions process for various graduate management programs, including
                        MBA (Master of Business Administration) programs.<br><br>

                        Exam Structure:
                        GMAT consists of four sections: Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), Integrated Reasoning (IR),
                        Quantitative Reasoning, and Verbal Reasoning.
                        The exam is computer-adaptive, meaning the difficulty level of questions adjusts based on the
                        test-taker's performance.<br><br>

                        Scoring:
                        GMAT scores range from 200 to 800, with separate scores provided for each section.
                        The AWA section is scored separately on a scale of 0 to 6.<br><br>

                        Importance of GMAT:
                        GMAT scores are a critical component of business school admissions criteria and are often used
                        by admissions committees to assess an applicant's readiness for graduate-level management
                        education.<br><br>

                        A competitive GMAT score can strengthen an applicant's candidacy and increase their chances of
                        admission to top-tier business schools.<br><br>

                        Preparation for GMAT:
                        Effective GMAT preparation involves studying relevant content, practicing with official GMAT
                        practice questions and exams, and familiarizing oneself with the exam format and timing.
                        Various test preparation resources, including study guides, online courses, and practice tests,
                        are available to help candidates prepare for the GMAT exam.<br><br>

                        Taking GMAT:
                        GMAT exams are administered at designated test centers worldwide.
                        Candidates can register for the GMAT exam on the official GMAT website and select their
                        preferred test date and location.<br><br>
